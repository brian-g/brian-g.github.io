            <p>I am a user experience designer specializing in interaction design, information architecture, user interface architecture, patterns, and design systems. At FarmQA, an ag-tech startup, I serve as the director of product and user experience and have many different hats that I wear &mdash; including SEO and marketing, testing, front-end development, and managing iOS/Android releases. Formerly, I focused on enterprise human resources and financial software within Microsoft Dynamics.</p>
            <p>As a life-long learner, I am an expert in HTML, CSS, and accessibility guidelines. My expertise in these concepts translates into better designs for the user. I also bring the ability to refine and perfect the user interface as delivered by engineering into an app that is usable and desirable by the users. While not an expert yet, I have been learning how to optimize a web site for search.</p>
            <p>The best design feedback is direct customer feedback. Instrumental to design is understanding customer problems. The best way to understand customer problems is to talk to them.</p>
            <p>Design is a collaborative effort, not solo. User experience is about bringing a voice to the user to engineering and product management. Personas, wireframes, prototypes, and style guides are part of the collaboration toolbox with the product team.</p>
