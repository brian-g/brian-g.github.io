				<ul>
					<li>Completed 2 stages of the redesign of FarmQA Controller. The first phase involved reworking the base navigation. 
                        The 2nd was redesigning the map interface. Goals of both efforts were to make an elegant, usable, consistent, and appealing
                        experience for our users.

						<li>Delightful - We wanted to improve upon the flow and function of the AX animations and took it to another level.</li>
