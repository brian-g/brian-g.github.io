			<p>I am a user experience designer working for Microsoft. I came to work at Microsoft via 
			the acquisition of Great Plains Software in 1999.</p>
			<p>As a user experience designer, I work to design and craft the user interface of Microsoft's Dynamics 
			products. When I say <em>design and craft</em>, I mean that I and a team of other UX designers and researchers 
			look at the people who use our software &mdash; generally people working in accounting or other aspects of business &mdash;
			and craft solutions that help them do their work.
			Our job is to ensure that the software
			works the way the people using the software want it to work, instead of forcing them to work they way we think they should.</p>
			<p>User experience design is an intersection of art, science, intuition and passion. It is the careful application
			of each of these that makes a great experiences for the people using our software. My passion is for well designed
			application and experiences for all technology users.</p>
			<p>Dynamics AX is an ERP (enterprise resource planning) suite that allows a company control every aspect of their
			business from accounting, human resources, distribution and more.</p>
