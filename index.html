					<p>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Talent is a re-imagined version the Microsoft Dynamics AX Human Resources module. As the primary

					<ul>
						<li>Simplicity. Since this was migrated from AX, it was inheriting a fair bit of complexity.</li>
						<li>Delightful. We wanted to improve upon the flow and function of the AX animations and took it to another level.</li>
						<li>Functional. And above all we still had to be functional and do all of the things that human resource managers needed
							as well as employees.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I also designed the innovative "people centric" navigation paradigm that focused the main navigation on people. The
						key element of this design is the people navigator, which presents the organization chart of a company as the primary
						way to navigate the product.</p>

							<p>This is one of the first explorations around re-envisioning the data presentation within the ERP system. In this case,
								we expanded upon concepts in the popular GP SmartList utility by adding better filtering and actions in a ribbon.</p>
							<p>By the time this version of GP shipped, we had implemented a new set of user interface controls for navigation, and
								actions.</p>

							<p>This is a vision for the Dynamics GP home page. The home page was to show the user a summary of the work that they
								had to do in the system as well as important business metrics and insights.</p>

							<h4></h4>
							<p>This screen shows the implementation of a design that became the
								<em>Advanced Security</em>
								utility. The key problem addressed by the design was the fact that many administrators did not set up security in GP. As
								it turned out, the problem was that the interfaces for setting up security were too hard to use. This design presented
								the elements to secure in a similar way to how a user would navigate to the item. This made the task of securing
								a resource much easier and more predictable.</p>

					<p>The owner of Oasis Plantscapes wanted a presence on the web for his business. After a discussion with him of the key
						requirements, I created several options as composites for the owner to review. The composites used Oasis Plantscapes
						original color schemes. The basic information to organize was information about the work that Oasis performs, information
						about the company, and a portfolio of their work.</p>
					<p>The pages were generated using PHP to allow reuse of the HTML across the pages and to dynamically populate the portfolio
						album.</p>

			<h2>Home theater</h2>
			<p>At one point I was an avid early adopter of everything home theater. As of late
			my system is composed of:</p>
			<ul class="links columns3">
				<li>HDTV - Sony Bravia 50in SXRD</li>
			<li>A/V Receiver - <a href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Home/AV-Receivers/Pioneer+Receivers/VSX-1018AH-K">Pioneer VSX 1018AH</a></li>
				<li>Front speakers - JBL HLS 610</li>
				<li>Surround - Sony SR-30</li>
				<li>Subwoofer - <a href="http://hsuresearch.com/products/vtf-2mk4.html">HSU VTF-2 MK4</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>All of this equipment, with the exception of the subwoofer is going on 5 years old. A couple of notes about
			the Sony TV. This is Sony's version of DILA technology. It is like DLP, but uses a reflective
			LCD (3 of them) to create the image. The advantage of this technology is that there is very
			little gap between the pixels and very good blacks and color rendering. The only problem is that
			every 3 years I need to replace the projection bulb.</p>

			<h2>Cars</h2>
			<p>Rather late in life, I've become a car nut of sorts. It all started with my purchase
			of a 2006 MINI Cooper S. I really do love my MINI, despite its best efforts to discourage me.
			As a family, we also own a 2013 Mazda CX-5, which despite being a bit oversized, is a really
			nice family car. Some of the modifications I've made to my MINI include:</p>
