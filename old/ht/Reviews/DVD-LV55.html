<H1>Panasonic DVD-LV55 Portable DVD Player/LCD Screen</H1>
<P>As we're preparing for a long trip in the car, my wife and I
wonder how to keep our darling girl occupied. She is starting act
like she's two, even though she is a couple of months shy of that
milestone. In my time, we sat in the back of the car and we liked it.
Today... well, today every body has to be enshrouded into their
individual seats, with no chance of moving a hair.</P>
<H2>Video:</H2>
<P>It looks good. It looks good until you expect to see something
that you don't. One of the first discs I popped in was <I>Final
Fantasy: The Spirit Within</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">. The
first chapter of the film is gorgeous and at first glance when played
on this player, also look better than my HDTV. Second and third
glances reveal something funky is going on. First and most obvious is
that there is an incredible amount of artificial sharpness added that
affects edges in the horizontal direction. </SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">But why over-crank the sharpness like
this? This is an LCD screen, where the pixels are very defined, why
did the designers think we needed artificial sharpness? I can only
guess as to the answers. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed with
this feature. Too bad they didn't think to let us determine how much
sharpness to use.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">This player is not a true progressive
player. LCD screens do not have the ability to display interlaced
material very well, all interlaced material must be doubled. This
Panasonic does not 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Other video attributes such as black
level and color are acceptable. After all, this is never going to
take the place of your primary monitor for watching DVD's, and will
probably be used in less than optimal locations, thus why get to
disturbed by worrying about perfect color temperature. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The zoom mode that you have to use for
non-anamorphic discs is really horrific. Lots of stairstep artifacts
become present and the picture is nearly unwatchable. CGI scenes from
<I>Titantic</I> are might as well have been created on an original
Apple Macintosh with all of the pixelization detracting from the
picture. Either this problem will cause you not to buy this player,
or not buy anamorphic DVD's.</P>
<H2>Sound:</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Well, what can be said for something
like &frac12;&quot; speakers that are 8 inches apart? The DVD player
has a built in DTS decoder, so you can play DTS DVD's over the 2
small speakers (you're probably better off using the 2 channel Dolby
digital track on most DVD's.) The player implements a feature called
V.S.S. (Virtual Surround Sound). I tried it in a couple of scenarios
and with a couple of discs and never felt that any of the V.S.S.
Modes was better than when it was off.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">One extra feature related to audio is
something that helps enhance the dialogue. 
</P>
<H2>Usability:</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Other than some minor quibbles like
incomprehensible icons used instead of text on some on-screen
displays, the player was very easy to use. The buttons on both the
remote and the console have a fairly decent tactile feel. The remote
works pretty good for something the size of a credit card.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The LCD screen is a bit hard to see in
bright light, like a car in the day time. Of course there is a
problem with using it in the car; the proper adapter from Panasonic
is $149. What? How can you charge $149 for a 12V to 9V adaptor? 
Well, after some searching, I found an adaptor from Radio Shack (CAT
273-1816) for around $23. The one caveat is that you can not charge
the DVD players battery from the car without overloading the adaptor
because of a mismatch in rated power handling.</P>
<H2>Recommendations:</H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">This is not the portable DVD player/LCD
screen to get. The jury is out on some of the newer models with
larger screens.</P>
