		<h1>Cable ONE and Digital Cable </h1>
		<address><font size="-4" color="#777777">Brian Glaeske</font></address>
		<P>?Get free digital cable for a year? cries the advertisement. I did. Only kept it for a month. Here is why.</P>
		<P>I was one of the first in the community of Fargo, ND to try out the pitch for digital cable. I was very excited to say the least. I did not have any preconceived notions that this was HDTV or anything. The STB (Set Top Box) that CableONE gave me was a Motorola DTC-2000. A fairly decent box with S-Video output and coax digital audio output (SP/DIF). This was great, I was drooling over the prospect of digital sound output on my favorite shows.</P>
<P>Well I got the box home and setup and into my system. My TV at the
time was an older 27&#148; without S-Video. I hooked up digital audio
and stereo outputs into my A/V receiver as well as the composite
output (the receiver does switching). First problem of course is a
fairly normal one, whenever you combine a STB and a TV and VCR, your
ability to time shift programs is effectively screwed. There are
about a zillion ways to hook up a VCR with a STB and none of them
good.</P>
<P>Still hopeful, I start using the STB. I set up my preferences,
figure out the some of the features of the guide and the like. First
thing I noticed about the guide, about 1/3 of the guide screen real
estate is taken up with advertisements. In fact, I can only see an
hour of programming at a time. Jeez, the TV Guide channel shows me an
hour and a half. <B>Strike One! </B>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">I figure that I can just zip forward
and back in the guide to see that next hour of programming easily
enough, I am not to concerned by this cozy screen layout. I hit the
forward button and ... seconds later the next hour appears, ever so
slowly. <B>Strike Two!</B> This guide is slow. Not only is the guide
slow, but the whole box is slow. Channel changes were so slow, you
just about about get up and change it the old fashioned way.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Those were still fairly minor
complaints, until I notice something. The channels 2-60 which I
received before, were still crappy. The colors faded and the blacks
washed out. How could this be? The channels that I got for a month
for free with number &gt; 100, the premium channels, were crystal
clear. Then it dawned on me, digital cable doesn't mean all of the
channels will be digital quality, only those special ones. <B>Strike
Three!</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">It is hard to comprehend the lunacy
behind all of this. All of the digital advertisements claim digital
quality. The ads are not wrong, they're just mostly wrong. So to get
any benefit from digital cable one has to subscribe to the premium
movie channels and eventually pay $8.95 a month. What a deal, get you
coming and going. Now they are offering additional channels for
$4.95/month. $14 gets you mostly 10 extra channels! What a deal.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Long story short, don't believe the
hype, digital cable is not better than normal plain cable. It is
simply a way of riding the digital hype and giving less, but charging
you more.</P>
