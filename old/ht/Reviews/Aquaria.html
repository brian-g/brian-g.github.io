<P>You bought that brand spanking new HDTV and you just love to tweak
it. You watch all of you DVD&#146;s on it over and over since there
ain&#146;t no HDTV programming anywhere, &#145;cause the broadcasters
still don't believe anyone is buying the damn things. Then your wife
tells you have to play with your kid instead of the TV and you
wonder, how will I ever get the set (and the kid) broken in so I can
get ISF to calibrate it?<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> The
solution, turn it in to an aquarium and entertain the kid at the same
time.</SPAN></P>
<P>Aquari <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">is a DVD that allows you
to choose from five different aquarium settings and four different
soundtracks. Also included is an detailed catalog of the fish shown
on the disc, thus allowing you to use it as a resource for planning a
real aquarium. Each of the different aquariums are in a different
setting, only one of which is a freshwater tank.</SPAN></P>
<P>The five aquariums include &#148;Classic&#148;, &#147;Natural&#148;,
&#147;Coral Reef&#148;, &#147;Exotic&#148; and &#147;Freshwater&#148;.
Each is stocked with different fish in different surrounding, sure to
please all. Each tank has a setting that at allow you to put the
video in a loop so that it starts over at the end. The Aquari DVD has
a &#147;close-up&#148; mode that follows many of the fish around the
tank and lets one examine them closer also optionally allowing
looping playback. I found this close-up mode to my liking as the
background changed more often to avoid &#147;burn-in&#148; of my
monitor and let me see the stunning fish and fauna in incredible
detail.</P>
<P>What more to say about this DVD. There is no story or acting to
talk about (although the fish do put on much better performances than
certain gladiatorial thespians) and no plot development. Just pure
unadulterated visual stimuli.</P>
<P>The DVD is a DVD-18 with three aquariums on one side, two
aquariums and DVD-ROM content on the other. The DVD-ROM content
consists of  screensavers and calendars for Microsoft Windows
platforms. All of the &#147;fishographies&#148; are also copied for
the DVD-ROM portion. The screen<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">savers
are rather interesting, because actual video clips are copied onto
your system from the DVD-ROM (about 25MB each). My only real
complaint with the DVD-ROM software is that it installs by default to
C:\Aquari instead of the standard c:\Program Files\Aquaria and will
not allow you to change the install directory. When are software
vendors going to realize why Microsoft went through the trouble of
creating the &#145;Program Files&#146; directory? I have also
received reports of this screensaver locking up machines.</SPAN></P>
<P>Video:</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">All of the video is presented in
anamorphic widescreen. The producers claim that it was digitally
recorded. The video is excellent. </SPAN>
</P>
<P>At first, I though that this is DVD made use of Pan and Scan on
the fly. The packaging claims &#147;You can view all the tanks and
variations in total 16:9 widescreen, if you have a widescreen TV.
With a standard TV you can view the disc in letterbox. The disc also
plays full screen on standard TVs&#148;. I switched my player back
and forth between 16:9 mode and P&amp;S mode and could find no
difference in the picture. I believe that the disc does make use of
P&amp;S codes, but only to ensure that the DVD players doesn't
perform letterbox down conversion, thus displaying the anamorphic
video unaltered. This has the effect of making the fish a little
shorter than they normally would be, but if you donut know the
difference, it probably won't matter.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">There isn't a speck of dirt or film
grain apparent on any of the video. The video is incredible and very
close to life-like. I expected more, which I'm sure is due to the
fact that I expected the much more fine detail from the small fish.
This is why I preferred the close-up mode, since I wasn't bothered by
not being able to resolve the smaller fish.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Audio:</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Two of the audio tracks are 5.1
musical selection best described as relaxation tunes. Waves and
aquarium sound compose the other two tracks. The relaxation music
features very good low extension on the LFE track and very ambient.
The audio tracks aren't real flashy, but nor do they have to be.</SPAN></P>
