<H3>JVC XV-D723GD DVD/DVD-Audio Player</H3>
<P>I decided to give the JVC XV-D723GD DVD/DVD-Audio player a spin. I
wanted to give the DVD-Audio capabilities as well as the 480P output
a whirl. I&#146;ve been avoiding the JVC players after several
friends with JVC players have had quality problems and inability to
play various DVD had me worried. As an aside, a much more technical
review of this player can be found at Secrets of HomeTheater HIFI.
This review simply is my opinion on this product.</P>
<H4>General Impressions:</H4>
<P>The 723GD is a gold (hence the GD) colored unit. I would prefer
the black version that goes by with the model number of XV-D721BK,
but nobody stocks them. The build of the unit is fairly standard for
mid-range components and won&#146;t win any awards. The LCD display
is quite readable at a distance, but does not allow dimming. The
drawer slides in and out fairly sturdily, but probably won&#146;t
stand up to my 2 year old falling on it (but would many). The back
contains the normal array of outputs and a switch with two options of
525i or 525p. Obviously, these should be labeled 480i or 480p
respectively. For some reason someone was reading the DVD spec a
little too closely when they did these labels. Guess what? Its a DVD
player, no big suprise here.</P>
<H4>Technical Performance:</H4>
<P>I&#146;m not qualified or experienced enough to give a technical
evaluation of this product. See reviews at Secrets of HomeTheater
HIFI or <A HREF="http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/SoundAndVision/Article01/TestReports/JVC0401/Jvc0401p03.html">Sound
&amp; Vision</A> for technical performance.</P>
<H4>Video Performance:</H4>
<P>With my Toshiba 40H80, I was pleasantly impressed. Running through
a gamut of <I>Dances with Wolves (DTS) </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">at
the beginning of chapter 4? the reigns of t, </SPAN><I>Titantic</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
chapter 8 with the ship rails. All tests passed with flying colors.
Everything was subtlety better than I remembered it to be (my Pioneer
DV-414 is a good steady player, but soft looking compared to the JVC.
As I said, much has been said about this players ability to do video
progressively.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">It is really nice. You&#146;ll really
be amazed.</P>
<H4>Audio Performance:</H4>
<P>It was fine. Didn&#146;t notice anything bad nor really good. The
unit has built in DD and DTS decoders with some marginal bass
management. The manual really doesn&#146;t help you set it up very
well and the built in test tones are rather useless (see usability
for more information).</P>
<P>Again, check with other reviews for a more technical review of the
audio performance.</P>
<H4>Usability:</H4>
<P>The setup and configuration screens, combined with very little
description in the manual, make this DVD player a nightmare to setup
and configure. What does DTS Bass Management compared to normal bass
management? The manual does little to explain, nor does it ever
inform one as to the what the fixed crossover point is when you set
your speakers to small. It forces you to set speaker delays using
time rather than distance. The LFE channel level is unconfigurable.
It is impossible to set the speaker levels using a DVD such as Avia
or Video Essentials because the setup menu is in accessible when
playing a DVD.</P>
<P>This player suffers from the same problem afflicting all current
DVD-Audio players, they don&#146;t perform bass management on the
data before sending the stuff to the analog outputs. Most receivers
in turn don&#146;t typically perform bass management on their 5.1
inputs. This means that unless you have 5 full range speakers, you&#146;re
losing some of the bass information in DVD-Audio. Many manufacturers
are trying to address this need. Outlaw Audio, THM Labs and M&amp;K
are three companies that currently have or will have devices to
perform bass management in the analog domain. These products are the
<A HREF="http://www.outlawaudio.com/news/june2001news.html">Outlaw
ICBM</A> (release July or August 2001 for $249). TMHLabs Bass Manager
at <A HREF="http://www.tmhlabs.com/">http://www.tmhlabs.com/</A> or
M&amp;K&#146;s LFE-4 ($800).</P>
<P>The user interface is a nice graphical interface that simulates
using a GUI on a computer. The on-screen display for each type of
format was kinda cool. It was irritating that the setup menu was
inaccessible while playing a disc of any type. The remote control is
frustrating to say the least. Get a good backlit universal remote
control and save yourself years fumbling.</P>
<P>The screen saver won&#146;t kick in when paused during a movie. It
just dims.</P>
<P>When in 16:9 Auto mode, it does cool things. It lets you leave
your TV in full mode no matter the title, anamorphic, letterbox or
4:3. I was not really able to figure out how it scales letterbox
images.</P>
<P>The player processes DVD menus very fast (compared to a 2 yr. old
DVD player). This makes going through all the extra features a
breeze.</P>
<P>I never got the &#147;memo&#148; or &#147;bookmark&#148; feature
to work. The player never really gave me any indication of when to
&#147;press&#148; the button on the remote and I never bothered to
read the manual. Of course the real issue is that some DVD&#146;s are
just plain mastered incorrectly so that this feature doesn&#146;t
work, but players should try a little bit harder than JVC did on this
one.</P>
