			<p>Welcome to the Fargo/Moorhead HDTV page. Check here for the latest status on High Definition TV in the Fargo area. I'll update this page on a regular basis, 
				so check back here, or see the <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=391243">AVSForum thread</a> devoted to discussion of 
				HDTV in Fargo/Moorhead and Grand Forks.</p>
			<p>I'm not going to update this page in the future as the cable providers are adding channels faster than I can usually keep up with. Check with your local cable company 
				for the latest channel HD channel lineup offered by them.</p>
			<p><strong>All</strong> local broadcasters are broadcasting HD content in the Fargo/Moorhead area 
				and are <strong>free</strong> to anyone with a new DTV (digital TV) and an 
				<a href="http://www.antennaweb.org/">antenna</a>.</p>
				
			<p><a href="http://www.antennaweb.org/">Antenna Web</a> also maintains a utility to help you pick an
				antenna for your location. See the <a href="http://www.antennaweb.org/aw/Address.aspx">Antenna Web Locator</a> 
				for more details.</p>

			<h2>DTV Transition</h2>
				<p>Are you looking for information on the DTV transition? Are you looking for information on converter boxes? If so, you can find great
					information at "<a href="http://www.dtv.gov/whatisdtv.html">The Digital TV Transition</a>" site, hosted by the federal government.</p>
				<p>In February 2009, all television stations are being mandated to stop broadcasting their traditional analog signal and instead 
					broadcast only a digital signal. For older televisions to receive the new DTV broadcast they will need a converter box. All new 
					DTV televisions will be able to tune and view the new DTV signals. Currently, this change will only effect television received over-the-air (OTA)
					and should not affect cable television.</p>

			<h2>Cable TV Status</h2>
			<p>The Fargo/Moorhead community is served by two cable television providers, <a href="http://www.cableone.com/">Cable ONE</a> and <a href="http://www.midcocomm.com/">Midcontinent Communications</a>. 
				Both have HD programming available. CableONE support QAM in the Clear only for local programming (currently limited to ABC, PBS and FOX). It is unknown if Midcontinent also provides HD unencrypted. The following table lists the cable channel numbers. Clear QAM numbers will be different.</p>
			<p>It appears that the cable providers are starting to be required to 
				encrypt all non-local programming. Thus, only locals are available 
				without a CableCARD or a cable providers set top box.</p>
			<p>All local broadcasters content is available at no additional charge
				to customers of CableONE who have the basic service. You must have
				a TV with the an integrated tuner to receive these channels.</p>

			<h3>CableCARD</h3>
			<p>Cable ONE also offers
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD">CableCARDs</a> for those with CableCARD equipped TVs and devices. They charge $2.95/month for each
			card. They also offer multi-stream CableCARDs (M-cards). It is unknown what Midcontinent charges for CableCARDs or if they even offer CableCARD support.</p>
			<p>The current TiVo HD DVR lineup supports CableCARDs and MCards. TiVo HD is capable of tuning OTA and QAM programming, but must have a CableCARD
				to be able to provide guide information for cable HD channels. This necessitates using a CableCARD from Cable ONE if you want to use the
				guide on your TiVo HD.</p>
