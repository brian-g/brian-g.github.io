<h1>My Home Theater</h1>
Here is my humble home theater (aka the family room), and all of my equipment.
My setup is fairly modest but quite satisfactory for me and mine. Here
is the run down:

		<ul>
<li>Toshiba 40H80 RPTV</li>
<li>Pioneer VSX-D608 A/V Reciever</li>
<li>JBL HLS-610 Main Speakers</li>
<li>JBL N-Center Center Speaker</li>
<li>Sony SR-30 Surround Speakers</li>
<li>HSU VTF-2 Subwoofer</li>
<li>Panasonic RP-56 DVD Player</li>
<li>Sony CE-776 SACD Player</li>
<li>Replay 5040 PVR</li>
<li>Samsung SIR-T150 HD-OTA receiver</li>
</ul>
		<h2>
The Room:</h2>
		<a href="WideBig.jpg">
</a>First off, here is a picture of the room facing forward. This room is in
the basement of my smallish house. My <a href="BasementHT.gif">basement</a>
is only 10.5' by 26' (see <a href="BasementHT.gif">floorplan</a>), I barely
fit the 40H80 down the stairs being that in the 1950's when the house was
built, the basement really only served as storage and a storm shelter,
not as part of the primary living area in the house.
<p>The builtin shelves at the front of the room are my masterpieces. The opening for the shelves retains the arch that is found in many of the doorways in the rest of the house, and the shelves themselves are solid oak that appear to &quot;disappear&quot; into the walls. This was not the easiest bit of drywalling an amateur like me attempted. It worked out the for the best.<p>The only (well probably not only) bad thing about the room is that I
did not get the sound treatments and dimensions perfect to remove the room
modes. Oh well, there is always next time.
<p>Here is a picture of the room showing off the lighting, which also highlights
some of the other features of the room better. I finished this basement
myself over a period of about 4 months (I think the wife thinks it was
longer). We had just demolished what was in basement in order to fix a
moisture problem (one might call it a flood). We had inside draintile put
in. While this is probably not the perfect solution (it is a lot like fixing
a leak with buckets) it has kept the water out through some pretty torrential
rains.
<p>
The back of the room features toys... Our daughter Annastasia has her
playarea in the back. We also have some mouse house lithographs that we're
trying to pass off as find art in the back of the room. One of the best
reasons to order special editions of DVD's directly from Di$ney is to get
these very fine pictures.&nbsp;<p>Enough
about the room, let's talk equipment.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Speakers:</h2>
You can obviously see the TV in the first couple of pictures, so lets talk
speakers. My main speakers are
<a href="http://www.jbl.com/">JBL HLS-610's</a>
standing on <a href="http://www.studiotech.com/">StudioTech</a> SS-24 stands.
HLS-610 are rated at 55Hz - 20KHz (~3dB) with a maximum power of 125 watts.
These are really quite nice speakers for my smallish room. My center speaker
is a JBL Northridge N-Center.
<p>All in all, I am quite impressed with the JBL speakers. I had an opurtunity
to listen to some M&amp;K speakers recently, and to my untrained (and slightly
deaf) ears there was only a marginal difference.
<p>My surround
speakers are Sony’s. They are <a href="sr30.jpg">SS-SR30</a> and I bought them because I liked the design. They fit the general description of bipoler and fit quite nice in the top of the wall pointing diagnally towards the listening area. I?ll probably eventually replace the drivers in these speakers with full range 3&quot; car speakers. I now have 4 of these speakers.&nbsp;Two mounted on the side and 2 at the rear. The speakers for each side are wired in parrellel. I have decided to live with the consequenses of presenting a 4 ohm load to the reciever. I figure the surround speakers don't get driven that hard.<br>
			&nbsp;
<h2>
A/V Receiver:</h2>
My receiver is a Pioneer VSX-D608. The 608 is a Dolby/DTS receiver with
S-Video switching and a lots of inputs and outputs. I am pretty happy with
this receiver, however, it took awhile to like. The receiver has a cheap
analog to digital converter. This makes all analog inputs (most notably
CD), sound poor. The solution is to use the “direct” feature on the receiver
which bypasses the A-D converter.
<p>My upgrade plan is to replace this receiver either with another Pioneer,
or an Outlaw model. Either way, I would minimally get a 7.1 receiver.
<p>All in all at the end of the day, the Pioneer is a very good budget
reciever. It has decent bass management features (only down to 100hz),
remembers settings for every input, lots of digital inputs and very easy
setup. I really can't complain.
<h2>
Subwoofer:</h2>
My pride and joy is the <a href="http://www.hsuresearch.com/">HSU VTF-2</a>
subwoofer. This subwoofer is probably the best subwoofer that $500 can
buy. Most professional reviewers find that this subwoofer has the performance
of subs costing double its price. Added to that, Dr. Hsu, the proprietor
of HSU Research is quite helpful, providing service you don't find very
often today.<br>
		&nbsp;
<h2>
TV:</h2>
I've now had my Toshiba for about a year and a half. I've been very happy
with this TV since the day I got it and until the day it broke (that's
another story).
<p>So far I've done some tweaks, but have not had it ISF calibrated. I
live in the middle of no where and there ain't much for calibrators out
here.
<p>I made my own convergence grids to converge it in service mode. I'm
probably eventually going to tackle some focus issues. I really need to
build a lens hood for it as my next tweek (I have already lined it with
duvatyne).
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>CD Player:</h2>
I purchased a Sony SACD CE-775. This is considered by some one of the best budget SACD players around.
It has rudimentary bass management (but no time alignment) for SACD multi-channel sources.
I've been pretty happy with it and less happy with the quality of SACD software that I'm interested in... Not 
everyone buys every Miles Davis album that comes out.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
DVD Player:</h2>
My DVD player is a Panasonic RP-56. Many consider this the one of the best progressive players
for the money. 

<p>I'm always on the hunt for a new DVD player. At one time it looked like
Outlaw was going to do a DVD player, but I don't think we'll see one from
them for a while. I've evaluated the Panasonic RP-56 and that player looks
pretty promising. I'm actually waiting for a good progressive/DVD-A combo
player with integrated bass management for DVD-A.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Remote:</h2>
I found an Home Theater Master MX-1000 on eBay for real cheap and decided
to go with it. For those unfamiliar witht the MX-1000, it is a touch screen
remote sort of like the Philips Pronto, but with a couple of more hard
buttons.
<p>Overall, the remote is capable, but the software for designing with
it is not. I would never recommend that anybody actually purchase a MX-1000
for their own use. If only the software didn't suck or if HTM released
it as open-source, then maybe it would be a recommendable peice of hardware.
<h2>
Equipment Rack:</h2>
I ended up mounting a plate glass shelf above and behind the Toshiba. I
was consdering using <a href="http://www.vogelsusa.com/evolv2.html">Vogel's
TVA 2046 Evolution Wall Mounts</a> but they are priced at about $48/each
and my solution cost about $50 total. Here are the <a href="ShelfPlan/index.html">plans
and instructions</a> for building one for yourself.
