<h1>
Plate Glass Shelf Plans</h1>
I needed a good shelf to put my equipment on so that my child would not
play with it. I also wanted that shelf to look good at the same time. My
room is kinda small and thus off the shelf shelfs were not an option either.
My wife suggested that I put the reciever and DVD player on a shelf above
the TV. Perfect I thought, now just to find the right material.
<p><img SRC="shelf_close.jpg" NOSAVE height=289 width=400 align=LEFT>I
didn't want wood because it wasn't elegant enough for a shelf that juts
out 20". I looked at glass shelving, but the kits they sell in home stores
can't really hold the weight I intended. I search the web using many a
search term. One company offered hardware of the exact nature that I wanted,
but the specs for the system limited the shelf depth to 16", 4 short of
what I wanted. I toyed with the idea of exceeding the specs, because most
hardware can probably exceed the capabilities of the spec, but I chose
not to.
<p>What I did find at this company, was a very attractive shelf bracket.
An idea struck upon me to combine this bracket with cables to make a glass
shelf that could carry the weight of the equipment with the size of glass
I needed.
   
<h2>Parts</h2>

<ul>
<li>1/4" plate glass 20" x 36", sanded edges, 1/4" holes drilled in two corners
along the long side 2" in from each edge.</li>

<li>3 Adjustable Shelf Bracket. Availble from <a href="http://www.advanceglass.com/clipbracket.html">Advance
Glass</a> for about $5.25 ea.</li>

<li>19 gauge or higher steel wire, sold in 50 ft. reels.</li>

<li>2 3/16" closed eyelets and bolts.</li>

<li>2 washers</li>

<li>2 1/4" lag bolt closed eyelets</li>

<li>Felt pads, self adhesive to act as a cushion between the glass and washers..</li>
</ul>


The plate glass should cost about $13.00-$20.00. Shops will charge extra
depending upon the type of edge put on. They'll also charge you more for
the holes. The adjustable shelf brackets will cost about $5.25 each plus
about $4 for shipping. The rest of the parts will cost about $5-10 at most
hardware stores.

<p>Get a partner to help you put it up.&nbsp;
<p>Note that the angle of the wire is probably not going to be exactly
90 degrees. That is alright because it is really quite invisible.</td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Detailed view of the assembly of the eyelets.
<p>Here you see that the wire is looped twice around the eyelet to add
a little more friction. The wire is cut about 2-3" longer so that it can
be twisted about itself.
<p>This diagram does not show the felt pad between the glass and the washer.</td>

<p>Finally, I should note that I am providing these plans without any warranty.
Thus, it worked for me, but I'm not an engineer and it might just fall
for you. I don't want to be held responsible. The people who cut glass
will be able to tell if the glass will handle the weight.
