<h2>My Mac History</h2>
<p>I've been using computers since around 1980. My first experience was with an 
Apple ][+ when I was in the sixth grade. In 1985 I finally scrapped up the money
to get an <a href="http://www.apple-history.com/?page=gallery&amp;model=aIIc">Apple //c</a>.</p>

<p>During college at <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/">NDSU</a>, I was introduced to <a href="http://www.apple-history.com/?page=gallery&amp;model=aIIc">Macintosh</a>
computers. Interestingly
enough, I couldn't use the <a href="http://www.guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/macos42">Mac</a>
interface. I was trying to copy a disk and couldn't figure it out.
I found a disk titled "Introduction to Macintosh". I worked throuh this tutorial for about 5 minutes; the light
bulb had already turned on. My mistake was assuming that it was like other computers, it wasn't.
From that point on, I was hooked on Macintosh, and to a larger extent Unix operating
systems. Both of my internships involved work with Macintosh computers to a great extent.</p>

<p>As a computer science student, most of our projects involved compiling using
a C compiler. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vax">DEC VAX</a> 
and later replacement the Solbourne, a Sun clone, provided me with 
an education of Unix and the Internet. Yes, the Internet was around in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet">1988</a>. 
</p>

<h2>NeXT</h2>
<p>In 1991, while working at an internship, I ordered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:NeXTstation.jpg">NeXTstation</a> from Steve Jobs' 
next company, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Computer">NeXT Computer</a>. I got the bare bones machine; 8MB of RAM, 105MB HD and a 25MHz 68030, all
for the cheap price of $3,000. I also have the first issues of the short lived <a href="http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/">NeXTWORLD magazine</a>. 
The computer only had a 100MB drive. I removed anything I didn't need that took up space (the OS took about 80MB) so I could
fit the development tools on. I have the first issues of the short lived NeXTWORLD magazine. It was here on the NeXTstation I learned about
object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>Object-oriented programming was, at first, quite a foreign concept to me.
Inheritence made no sense, methods and instance variables pure gibberish and delegates 
a nightmare. Finally, there was the <i>a ha</i> moment
where I finally got it all. Everything just clicked. it all made sense and I've
never looked back, I think in objects.</p>

<h2>Why Apple</h2>
<p>I could go on about lots of things about Apple Macintosh, but it really comes
down to only one thing. I like it.</p>

<p>I like it for a variety of reasons such as the industrial design of the hardware or the 
prettiness of Mac OS X. But as the next generation NeXT computer, I like it for
combination of hardware and software, the Unix underpinnings, the OS architecture and the 
object oriented development environment that I consider to be the best for developing applications 
for a GUI.</p>

<p>Why? I have experience developing applications under Win32, Mac OS and a variety of 4GL application builders.
The combination of the Cocoa application environment with the Objective-C language is one mighty combo. Objective-C is 
a dynamics language sharing many attributes with Smalltalk. Strong typed languages such as C++ and C#, while good
for systems level programming, really fall down for building user interfaces. Take one look at the code <i>generated</i>
when using Microsoft's Visual Studio environment. Apple's tools don't generate code, rather they store the
<i>connections</i> between elements of the user interface the controllers and the models. Yes, Cocoa implements 
Smalltalk's Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.</p>

<p>Obviously, a big reason I like Mac OS X is the BSD underpinnings. I believe that the overall architecture of OS X, 
is the key to future advances offered by Apple. The clean lines between what is <i>Unix</i> and what is OS X is key
to making all of the parts of the OS work effectively together in a loosely coupled fashion. It is also interesting that 
Apple puts key technologies in place a release before they expose them to users as a really cool feature.</p>

<h2>My Computers</h2>
<p>Over the years, I've owned the following computers. Actually, I still have all of these computers, and they still run (I think.)
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Apple //c - 1985</li>
	<li>NeXT NeXTStation 25MHz - 1990</li>
	<li>Apple iMac (Luxo Jr. Version) - 2003</li>
	<li>Apple iMac Aluminum - 2007</li>
</ol>

<h2>Favorite Applications</h2>
<p>I have some favorite application on OS X. This is that list.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="apps/Graffle.png" />OmniGraffle by the OmniGroup is one of the best
diagramming utilities out there. It doesn't have the kitchen sink of every feature
known to man (unlike some diagramming applications), but what it does have is 
something that makes it an elegant way to express yourself in diagrams. This is
an application that has its roots in an application called <i>Diagram!</i> on the
NeXT platform.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="apps/LaunchBar.png" />LaunchBar from the The Objective Group is 
probably my most frequently used application. I keep my dock relatively clutter
free and this program is a big reason for that. Mac OS X is a joy to use using
the keyboard only, and this application only makes the experience better.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="apps/iPhoto.png" />Apple's iPhoto application which is part of their
iLife suite is a great photo management program for all. Many complain that they
would prefer their photo manager to not construct its own database of their photos; that they
would prefer to manage the directories themselves. My response is don't use
iPhoto if that is the level of control that you want. 
</p>
<p><img alt="" src="apps/Photoshop.png" />What to say about Photoshop from Adobe that has not been said? I hope
everyone knows of its capabilities and uses by now. While iPhoto can handle 80% of
my photo manipulation needs, Photoshop covers the other 20%.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="apps/Chrono.png" />ChronoSync from Econ Technolgies is my sync manager 
of choice. I have a iBook G4 that sync my home directory from my desktop iMac. The
result is that I have all of my files with we whenever I need them. Chronosync just
deals with sync conflicts and I never worry. The really great thing is that I get
a free hourly backup of all of my important files.
</p>
<p><img alt="" src="apps/Kitty.png" />For games, my wife loves Kitty Spangles Solitaire from Swoop Software
fills her need for a Solitaire game or two. The game has a really cute theme
and lots of neat sounds. This is a good game for the Macintosh platform that is
more than just a port of some game from the PC.
</p>
<p><img alt="" src="apps/Keychain.png" />The builtin utility called Keychain rounds our my 
list of useful applications. Apple's KeyChain application quietly sits around
helping application such as Safari securely store logins and passwords for websites, files shares and
e-mail servers. KeyChain also provides a secure database for storing ATM pin numbers,
other private notes and certificates. 
</p>

<h2>My Applications</h2>
<p>Every know and then again, I get a bug to write an application for the Mac. My problem is 
that I rarely have the foritude to completely finish. So here are a couple of 
unfinished apps that mostly work, but are a bit rough around the edges. None of these
are Fat (Universal) binaries yet. Drop me a line and I'll get them recompiled.
</p>
<p>
<a href="apps/DockClockX.dmg"><img alt="" src="apps/DockClockX.png" />DockClockX</a> is an application I started in 
the NeXTStep days. In those days, the clock was provided on the dock via the 
Preferences application. I never had enough memory to run Preferences all
of the time, so I wrote my own clock for the dock. When I got a Mac, this was
one of the first applications that I ported to Cocoa. It <i>almost</i>allows 
plugins. It will crash if you change clocks too often, but works great if you
just leave it alone.
</p>
<p>
<a href="apps/*e*ris.dmg"><img alt="" src="apps/*e*ris.png" />&bull;e&bull;tris</a> 
is a port of a free Tetris clone for NeXTSTEP. I'm not too pleased with the game play
and I need to learn how to use Quartz better. I may just wait until Core Animation
is released for Mac OS X 10.5 and use this application as my introduction to
the animation platform.
</p>
<p>
<a href="apps/KidApps.dmg"><img alt="" src="apps/KidPaint.png" />KidApps</a> are 3 applications written for my daughter. They include
KidPaint, KidSpeak and KittyMath.
